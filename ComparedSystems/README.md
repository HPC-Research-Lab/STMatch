This repo contains the instructions for reproducing the results of Dryadic, CuTS, GSI in our experiments. 

More specificlly, the CuTS directory contains the source code and scripts for reproducing the results of CuTS in Table3a

The Dryadic directory contains three subdirectories. The three subdirectories, edge_unlabel_table3a, vertex_unlabel_table3b and edge_label_table4, include the test instructions for table3a, table3b and table4. Due to that drydic is not an open-sourced project, we only offered a docker image that contains executables for testing. Please follow the instructions in that 3 subdirectories for reproducing the results in the paper. 

The GSI directory contains the source code for reproducing the results of GSI in Table4

The following is the original links to CuTS and GSI. 
Dryadic is not open sourced and we got dryadic from the authors so we only offered a docker image for testing.
