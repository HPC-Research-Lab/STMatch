#### Introduction

each data file and each query file both contain only one graph.
In each graph, vertex has its ID and label, edges are directed and labeled.
(parallel edges and self loops are not allowed, and separated query graphs are not accepted)
When a query graph is separated into several parts which are totally not connected to each other, 
the results can be acquired by do a Cartesian product after the results of each part are found.
